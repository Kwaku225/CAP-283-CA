            EDUCATION AND LITERACY
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            <span class="indentation">What is the goal here?</span> Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning. <br>
            <span class="indentation">Why does education matter?</span> Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to 
            escaping poverty. Education helps reduce inequalities and reach gender equality and is crucial to fostering tolerance and 
            more peaceful societies. Over the past decade, major progress has been made towards increasing access to education and school 
            enrollment rates at all levels, particularly for girls. Nevertheless, about 258 million children and youth were still out  of 
            school in 2018 — nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, 
            countries announced the temporary closure of schools, impacting more than 91 per cent of students worldwide. By April 2020, close 
            to 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school. <br>
            <span class="indentation">What can we do?</span> Ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice. 
            Lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.

            ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            <span class="indentation">What’s the goal here?</span> To sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and 
            halt biodiversity loss. <br>
            <span class="indentation">Why?</span> Forests cover nearly 31 per cent of our planet’s land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to 
            the food we eat–forests sustain us.Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, 
            plants and insects. However, biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history. Globally, one 
            fifth of the Earth’s land area (more than 2 billion hectares) are degraded, an area nearly the size of India and the 
            Russian Federation combined. Land degradation is undermining the well-being of some 3.2 billion people, driving 
            species to extinction and intensifying climate change. Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also 
            be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that 
            will increase the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change. <br>
            <span class="indentation">What can we do?</span> Some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally-based diet that is sustainably sourced, 
            and consuming only what we need. We must be respectful toward wildlife and only take part in ecotourism opportunities that 
            are responsibly and ethically run in order to prevent wildlife disturbance. Well-managed protected areas support healthy 
            ecosystems, which in turn keep people healthy. It is therefore critical to secure the involvement of the localcommunities 
            in the development and management of these protected areas.

            HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            <span class="indentation">What’s the goal here?</span> To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. <br>
            <span class="indentation">Why?</span> Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is important to building prosperous societies. 
            However, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated health systems globally and threatens already 
            achieved health outcomes. Most countries, especially poor countries, have insufficient health facilities, 
            medical supplies and health care workers for the surge in demand. The pandemic has shown 
            that in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.
            Concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health;
            address the growing burden of zoonotic and non-communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and 
            environmental factors contributing to ill health.<br>
            <span class="indentation">What can I do to help?</span> You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those 
            around you, by making well-informed choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children. You can raise 
            awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right 
            to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.You can also hold 
            your government, local leaders and other decision-makers accountable to their commitments to improve people’s 
            access to health and health care.

            RIGHT INFORMATION AND ADVOCACY
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            <span class="indentation">What’s the goal here?</span> Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide 
            access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. <br>
            <span class="indentation">Why?</span> People everywhere need to be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go 
            about their lives whatever their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation.Conflict, insecurity, weak 
            institutions and limited access to justice remain threats to sustainable development. In 2019, the 
            number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 79.5 million, the highest level ever
            recorded. One in four children continues to be deprived of legal identity through lack of birth 
            registration, often limiting their ability to exercise rights in other areas. The COVID-19 pandemic 
            threatens to amplify and exploit fragilities across the globe. <br>
            <span class="indentation">What can we do?</span> Exercise your right to hold your elected officials to account. Exercise your right 
            to freedom of information and share your opinion with your elected representatives. Promote inclusion 
            and respect towards people of different ethnic origins, religions, gender, sexual orientations or 
            different opinions. Together, we can help to improve conditions for a life of dignity for all.
