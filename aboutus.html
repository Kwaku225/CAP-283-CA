            WHAT IS AN NGO?
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit organization, composed 
            of citizens defending a cause and acting independently of governments. <br>
            The main criteria defining an NGO are: <br>
            • the non-profit purpose of its action; <br>
            • financial independence; <br>
            • political independence; <br>
            • the notion of public interest. <br>
            NGOs or similar organizations exist in all parts of the world. An NGO can be local, 
            national, or international. Also, it can be associative, social, and humanitarian.

            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to transform our world. They are 
            a call to action to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet, and ensure that 
            all people enjoy health, justice, and prosperity. No one must be left behind. In 2015, 
            all the countries in the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
            Development. It sets out 17 Goals, which include 169 targets. These wide-ranging 
            and ambitious Goals interconnect.

            PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM
        </h2>
        <p class="para-info">
            Although the Sustainable Development Goals are a positive initiative to improve 
            people's lives and the health of the planet, they also face several challenges and 
            issues that can hinder their achievement. Here are a few.
            We live in a world that is changing and that says evolution says the need to adapt 
            in general, hence the need to invest in the education and training of all, especially 
            the most disadvantaged.
            Our society is full of imperfections, not because our governments are not 
            responsible but because the population is not aware of the issues facing society 
            and of the fact that simple gestures can contribute to improving our living 
            conditions and our environment. So, the problem of low awareness and 
            engagement takes place.
            Today, we are betting on the quality of our infrastructure, which is important for 
            the development and image of the country, but what about the citizens who must 
            benefit from this infrastructure? If the use of these infrastructures is intended for a 
            popular class of the population, then the problem of inequality arises in the 
            sharing and use of resources. Situation to be avoided to promote the well-being 
            of all.
